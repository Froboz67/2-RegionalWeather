# Regional Weather App

This Vue.js application provides a seven-day weather forecast for four U.S. regions: Cincinnati, Ohio; Athens, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; and Tucson, Arizona. Leveraging the National Weather Service (NWS) API, it delivers real-time regional weather data through a simple, intuitive interface with dynamic updates for each location. Additionally, the app integrates with the RCC-ACIS API to display record high and low temperatures for the current day at each location.

## Key Features

- **Seven-Day Forecast:** Access regional weather forecasts for four U.S. cities.
- **Historical Data Integration:** Uses the RCC-ACIS API to showcase daily record high and low temperatures.
- **Responsive Design:** Incorporates Bootstrap and dynamic queries for optimal viewing on various browser sizes and mobile screens.
  
## Future Enhancements

- **Radar Graphics:** Integration of radar imagery to provide real-time visual data. Currently studying [NWS Radar Tutorial](https://www.weather.gov/ctp/newradartutorial) for implementation.
- **Hourly Forecast:** Planning to add detailed hourly weather forecasts.
